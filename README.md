# Why employees leave?

The intangible asset such as employees can have positive and negative impact on companies. The self-motivated and engaged employees do not only increase the companies productivity but also create conducive atmosphere for working. On the other hand, hiring is an expensive process, which includes the cost of recruiting, training etc, not to mention the burden and negative impact to the remained empolyees. Therefore, it is important for the Human Resources Department to understand who resigned from the company and why they resigned.

For this reason, the goal of this project is to present the data by graphics and investigate why employees left the company. The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains categorical and numerical data.

## Pre-processing

The analysis started from getting a general information of the data. Including:
- What elements it contains?
- Is there any missing data?
- What about the data type?

The data was very clean and didn't contain any missing data. However, the data type of some columns need to be converted from object (string) to datetime. And the working period and age need to be calculated.


## Exploratory and Individual Analysis

After the data is processed, the analysis was deployed and deepen on the base of hypotheses.
- We started from the turn-over rate of the company and the correlation among the attributes
- Then, we analyzed the Top 3 terminatin reasons. We also explored the patterns regarding department, sex, working period, ect.
- As we also found the turn-over rate is extremely high in Production, we dived deepen to find the patterns and investigate the reason.
